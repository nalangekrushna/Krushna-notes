amazon neptune = fully managed graph database service 

aws x-ray = You can use AWS X-Ray to trace and analyze user requests as they travel through your Amazon API Gateway APIs to the underlying services. X-Ray gives you an end-to-end view of an entire request, so you can analyze latencies in your APIs and their backend services. 

AWS cloudfront Reports :
	Use Popular Objects Report to determine what objects are frequently being accessed, and get statistics on those objects.

From there, you can create highly specific requests (for example, m2.2xlarge costs within account Y with the “project: secretProject” tag applied).
Cost Explorer can display up to 12 months of historical data (if you have that much), the current month, and the forecasted costs for the next three months. for following scenario its best option : The SysOps Administrator needs to view the costs for the current month as well as the last three months. She also needs to be able to forecast expenses for the current billing period.

AWS Cost & Usage Report (very detailed)= The AWS Cost & Usage Report is your one-stop shop for accessing the most detailed information available about your AWS costs and usage. The AWS Cost & Usage Report can be generated at an hourly and/or daily level of granularity.  It includes additional metadata about AWS services, pricing, and reservations (for example, Amazon EC2 Reserved Instances).
