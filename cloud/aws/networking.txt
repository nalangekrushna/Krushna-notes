Networking

AWS Direct Connect (connection)= allows you to establish dedicated network connection from your premise to AWS region using private connection without going through internet. You need to connect to AWS direct connect location which are available in multiple cities. 

AWS direct connect does not encrypt traffic in transit by default. You can combine AWS VPC VPN with direct connect to provide IPSec encrypted private connection.  
customer data center => customer router => customer cage in AWS direct connect location => AWS cage in AWS direct connect location having AWS Direct connect endpoint => AWS direct connect in AWS region
Then we have a private Virtual Interface which connects to single AWS vpc in same AWS region of direct connect to a virtual Gateway on VPC.
WE also have a public virtual interface (VIF) which connects to all the AWS regions for the public endpoints.

AWS Direct Connect Transit Virtual Interface = this allows you to connect any account, any number of vpcs in any region. This interface connects with AWS VPC transit gateway.


aws direct connect connection between vpc and on-premise prerequisite
1. Your network must use single-mode fiber with a 1000BASE-LX (1310 nm) transceiver for 1 gigabit Ethernet or a 10GBASE-LR (1310 nm) transceiver for 10 gigabit Ethernet.
2. Auto-negotiation for the port must be disabled. Port speed and full-duplex mode must be configured manually. 
3. 802.1Q VLAN encapsulation must be supported across the entire connection, including intermediate devices.
4. Your device must support Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) and BGP MD5 authentication.

AWS Direct Connect Gateway = You can use an AWS Direct Connect gateway to connect your AWS Direct Connect connection over a private virtual interface to one or more VPCs in your account that are located in the same or different regions. You associate a Direct Connect gateway with the virtual private gateway for the VPC, and then create a private virtual interface for your AWS Direct Connect connection to the Direct Connect gateway. You can attach multiple private virtual interfaces to your Direct Connect gateway. A Direct Connect gateway is a globally available resource. You can create the Direct Connect gateway in any public region and access it from all other public regions.
One important exception is direct connect gateway didn't allow virtual gateways to send traffic to each other virtual gateways.

Elastic Load Balancer (elb) = If you need flexible application management or HTTP requests we recommend that you use an Application Load Balancer. Only Application Load Balancers support WebSockets, path-based routing, host-based routing and support for containerized applications. If extreme performance and static IP or For network/transport protocols (layer4 – TCP, UDP) load balancing, we recommend that you use a Network Load Balancer. If you have an existing application that was built within the EC2-Classic network, then you should use a Classic Load Balancer.

NAT gateway = NAT gateways in each Availability Zone are implemented with redundancy. Create a NAT gateway in each Availability Zone to ensure zone-independent architecture.

you need public subnet, EIP address and internet gateway to create nat gateway. gateway is created in specific AZ and implemented redundancy in same AZ. NAT gateway supports TCP, UDP and ICMP protocols

VPC endpoint = A VPC endpoint enables you to privately connect your VPC to supported AWS services using aws privatelink. Instances in your VPC do not require public IP addresses to communicate with resources in the service. Traffic between your VPC and the other service does not leave the Amazon network.

aws privatelink = provides private connectivity between different/same account VPCs, AWS services, and on-premises applications. 

If working and prev accessible instance stops working then first check if the instance is terminated then check for aws system status. If system status is impaired then stop and start your instance again to run it on healthy system.

Oracle db with RAC config is not supported by aws RDS so you have to use ec2 instance to host oracle db.

bastion host = A bastion host is a special-purpose computer on a network specifically designed and configured to withstand attacks. It is used to connect VPC from internet to get access to resources in private subnet.

RAID = raid is accomplished at software level. For greater I/O performance than you can achieve with a single volume, RAID 0 can stripe multiple volumes together; for on-instance redundancy, RAID 1 can mirror two volumes together which can also offer fault tolerance. RAID 5 and RAID 6 are not recommended for Amazon EBS because the parity write operations of these RAID modes consume some of the IOPS available to your volumes.

aws raid 1 vs raid 0 = raid 0 does striping (spliting data evenly across all the disk) while raid 1 does mirroring (create two copies of data.) use raid 0 when performance (I/O) is important and use raid 1 when fault tolerance and data redundancy is important. raid 1 storage capacity is half as it makes two copies of data. reading speed is same in both raid 0 and 1. but writing speed is less in raid 1.

If you want to use your internal private dns resolver with aws then create dns options set that include both DHCP option with dns= amazon provided and internal dns server.

Elastic Network Interfaces (ENIs) = Each instance in your VPC has a default network interface (the primary network interface) that is assigned a private IPv4 address from the IPv4 address range of your VPC. You cannot detach a primary network interface from an instance. You can create and attach an additional network interface to any instance in your VPC. ENI is only used to create and attach additional network interfaces for the EC2 instance.

EIP (elastic IP address) = static public IPv4 address. An Elastic IP address is associated with your AWS account and allows you to mask the failure of an instance or software by remapping the address to another Amazon EC2 instance in your account. you can have at max 5 eips.

The two major tools used to manage and troubleshoot VPC issues are as follows:
■■ AWS CloudTrail
■■ Amazon VPC Flow Logs
	
You need to establish a highly available connection between your Amazon VPC and your datacenter. What is the best way to accomplish this?
Set up a Virtual Private Gateway. Make sure that you have two customer gateways configured to avoid having single point of failure.
	
You are using Amazon Route 53 as your DNS provider. You have a web application that is running in your datacenter located in Las Vegas, NV and in the AWS Frankfort, Germany Region. What steps would you take to minimize the load times for this web application?
The latency measurement from your Las Vegas location will not be based on Las Vegas but will be based on the AWS Region that you associate with that record. In this case, it is recommended that you associate the us–west-1 Region located in Northern California. AWS can only create latency record sets in an AWS Region, not in a customer location.
	
You are trying to SSH in to an Amazon EC2 instance in your Amazon VPC but are unable to do so. What should you be checking?
Make sure that you have an Internet gateway attached to your Amazon VPC, that the VPC route table has an entry that routes packets to the Internet, that the Network ACL has an inbound and an outbound rule that allows SSH, and that the Amazon EC2 instance has a security group rule that allows inbound SSH. Make sure that the EC2 instance has a Public or Elastic IP address associated with it.
	
Origin Access Identity (OAI) is used to restrict access to your Amazon S3 content.
The subnet inherits the route table from the Amazon VPC.

When you configure Amazon CloudFront, an origin refers to which of the following? 
For static content, it is either an HTTP server or an Amazon S3 bucket. For media files on demand it is an S3 bucket.
	
A default Amazon VPC has a netmask of /20. It comes with an Internet gateway and a route table reflecting that Internet gateway. NAT and VPN can be added to the default VPC.

AWS client VPN = used to connect client device to AWS VPC subnet over internete using VPN endpoint. You will need to use VPN software on client side. It will add a route to VPN endpoint in AWS. VPN endpoint in aws will do source network address translation (snat) to assign you one of the address from aws subnet. This is useful in accessing vpc resources directly through your client device. 

AWS site to site vpn = Used to connect customer data center or office location into the AWS. AWS VPN is managed IPSec VPN. You need to create a Virtual Private Gateway in AWS and a customer gateway on other side to establish a VPN connection. It supports static routes or BGP peering/routing. You need to add a route in route table for customer data center cidr block and point it to Virtual Private Gateway.

AWS VPN Cloudhub = It's an architectural pattern used when you have multiple office or on-prem network and AWS site to site VPN. Here we follow hub and spoke model. ie. Every office premises is only connected to AWS site to site VPN. and they communicate with each other office premises by using virtual private gateway as hub. ie.thier communication passes through virtual private gateway even only they want to talk to each other. Only requirement is each on-prem network should have unique BGP Autonomous System Number. 

AWS transit Gateway = transit gateway is a network transit hub that connects vpc with each other and on-premises network. Your VPCs and customer gateways are all attached to transit gateway. You specify one subnet from each AZ to enable routing within the AZ. transit gateways can also be attached to VPNs, Direct connect Gateways, third party appliances and even other transit gateways in other regions or accounts. transit gateway is region scoped service.
