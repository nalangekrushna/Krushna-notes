Gradle Basics

Core Concepts

If root folder of project contains gradle sub-directory then it is a gradle project. another way to find gradle project is gradlew binary in the root folder of the project.

settings.gradle file contains a root project name and subprojects. build.gradle file contains build script this file can be at root level or sub-project/folder level.

./gradlew build is the recommeneded way to run the commands. as it also uses pre-defined version of gradle to run the commands.
